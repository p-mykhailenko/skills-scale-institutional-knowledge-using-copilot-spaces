# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Docs. This guide serves as an entry point to understanding our project management processes, roles, and best practices.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes facilitate transparent and repeatable delivery across cross-functional teams. Projects begin with **initiation** (business need validation and stakeholder alignment), followed by **planning** (work breakdown, prioritization, and risk identification), **execution** (progress tracked via project boards and regular syncs), **release** (standardized deployment and verification), and **retrospective** (continuous improvement).

### Key Roles and Personas

Our teams consist of the following roles (expanded in [issue #4](https://github.com/p-mykhailenko/skills-scale-institutional-knowledge-using-copilot-spaces/issues/4)):

**Core Roles:**
- **Project Managers**: Delivery coordination, risk management, and stakeholder communication
- **Product Managers**: Roadmap and outcome definition, backlog prioritization
- **Developers**: Feature implementation and testing

**Supporting Roles:**
- **Project Sponsor**: Strategic direction, resource allocation, and executive oversight
- **Business Analyst**: Requirements gathering and translating business needs to technical solutions
- **Quality Lead**: Quality assurance oversight and testing coordination
- **Communications Coordinator**: Stakeholder communication and information flow management
- **Change Manager**: Change impact assessment and adoption facilitation

**Additional Roles:**
- **QA/Testing**: Quality validation and testing
- **Stakeholders**: Approvals and feedback

For detailed role definitions, responsibilities, and interaction patterns, see [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md).

### Communication Strategies

Communication is structured through:

- Daily standups for development teams
- Weekly syncs between PM and Product teams
- Regular stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalation channels for urgent matters

### Quality Assurance Practices

Quality assurance involves:

- Automated and manual testing
- CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment
- Post-release verification
- Code reviews and acceptance criteria validation

### Continuous Improvement

Continuous improvement is driven by:

- Structured retrospectives after each project phase or sprint
- Risk and dependency management through a living register
- Regular monitoring of project health metrics
- Feedback loops from all stakeholders
